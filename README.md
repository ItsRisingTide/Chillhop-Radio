It's a chillhopRadio player as an alterenative to popular YouTube videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A&ab_channel=ChilledCow.
The idea is that because people really liked custom cyclic animation for a video to listen on a background I feel like
the same approach can be used in player apps.
With `gsap` library or smth else let's say an animated pixel art for an album can be very cool.
(such animation doesn't go for super realistic expensive special effects, it goes much more arty, funny or weird,
 and from my perspective really enhances experience)

This app though doesn't have this feature yet. 
Maybe one day I will have some nice pixel art to animate with https://github.com/jvalen/pixel-art-react
or figure out how to such things with gsap https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaoeZkm92t8&t=1s&ab_channel=Vaank

But there is a cool thing in that app: it tracks a color from an album picture and the music player bar has the same tones.
